# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign. The code uses a machine learning algorithm to train a model on a dataset of breast cancer tumors. The model is then used to predict the malignancy of new tumors.

# Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. Then, install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Code snippet

## Usage

To use the code, run the following command:

# Use code with caution. Learn more
python predict.py

This will prompt you to enter the path to a CSV file containing the features of a new tumor. The code will then predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

# Results
The code was tested on a dataset of 569 breast cancer tumors. The model was able to correctly predict the malignancy of 96% of the tumors.

# Future Work
The code could be improved by using a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm. Additionally, the code could be extended to predict the stage of breast cancer.
